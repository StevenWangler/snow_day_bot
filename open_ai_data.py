'''
This file takes weather data that has already been selected from an API call, puts it into a string,
then will put it into a json object which can be used by the ai engine. Because this is a 
linguistic mode, we need to build input as if we are physically speaking to someone. The more 
information and the more context that is provided, the more accurate of an answer 
we can get back from the model.

        Respond with a percentage chance that a snow day will occur tomorrow. Also, provide a one to two sentence
        explanation of how you came to that conclusion. Also, make this response in a tone of a high school student who uses
        cool language and is super popular. The schools name is {settings.SCHOOL_NAME}, so use that name when creating your response.
        
        Below you will find the weather conditions.

        The minimum temperature for the day will be {current_weather_data['current_day_mintemp_f']} degrees Fahrenheit, with
        a maximum temperature of {current_weather_data['current_day_maxtemp_f']} degrees Fahrenheit. The maximum wind speed
        for the day will be {current_weather_data['current_day_maxwind_mph']}MPH. The wind chill (or "feels like") is currently
        {current_weather_data['current_day_feelslike_f']} degrees Fahrenheit. As of now, there is a {current_weather_data['current_day_daily_chance_of_snow']}%
        chance that it will snow today. There is also a {current_weather_data['current_day_daily_chance_of_rain']}% chance that it will rain today.
        The total amount of precipitation today is going to be around {current_weather_data['current_day_totalprecip_in']} inches. The average humidity
        for today is {current_weather_data['current_day_daily_avghumidity']}%. The current day conditions are {current_weather_data['current_day_conditions']}.

        Tomorrow, the minimum temperature for the day will be {current_weather_data['next_day_mintemp_f']} degrees Fahrenheit, with
        a maximum temperature of {current_weather_data['next_day_maxtemp_f']} degrees Fahrenheit. The maximum wind speed
