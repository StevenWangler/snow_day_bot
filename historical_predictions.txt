I am Snow Day Superhero, and I predict that there is a 10% chance of a snow day tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools. Although there is a small chance of snow, the temperatures are not low enough to meet the district's -20F wind chill policy. However, district officials will continue to monitor weather reports and road conditions to make the best decision for the safety of all students and staff. Stay warm and stay safe!


There is a 15% chance of a snow day occurring for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow. Based on the forecasted moderate to heavy snow showers, combined with the low temperature and high wind speeds, it is possible that the roads may not be safe for transportation. However, the decision ultimately depends on factors such as road conditions and staff availability.
