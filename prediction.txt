After analyzing the weather data from 7 PM to 8 AM for Rockford Public Schools, here's a summary of the key findings:

- The **average wind speed** was approximately 7.1 MPH, which is considerably high but not extreme. 
- A **total snowfall** of 3.29 cm (about 1.3 inches) was recorded, with heavy snow occurring in the final two hours.
- The **lowest visibility** observed was 1.0 mile during the heavy snow period, indicating significant visibility reduction.
- The **lowest temperature** recorded was 31.1°F, which is above the extremely dangerous cold threshold.
- The **highest wind chill** experienced was 28.6°F, significantly warmer than the critical -20°F level for extreme concern.

Considering these observations against the snow day criteria, which prioritize wind chill, temperature, precipitation, and their impact on transportation and infrastructure, it appears conditions were adverse but not necessarily extreme by the criteria standards. The late onset of heavy snowfall might impede morning transportation, but wind chill and temperature stayed well above the danger levels.

Given the conservative stance outlined for decision-making and the importance of ensuring student and staff safety without prematurely closing schools, and considering there are no active severe weather alerts, I estimate the chance of a snow day tomorrow to be relatively moderate but not certain.

Thus, taking all factors and the conservative approach into consideration, I predict a **40% chance of a snow day** for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow. 🌨️🏫 Keep in mind, road conditions and local weather updates should be continuously monitored overnight for any unexpected changes.
