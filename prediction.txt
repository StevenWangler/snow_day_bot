After analyzing the hourly weather data:

- The wind chill does not reach the dangerous threshold of -20°F at any hour, remaining above 38°F.
- The temperature remains well above the -20°F mark, not indicating extreme cold conditions.
- While wind speeds are moderate, peaking at 16.1MPH, they do not present extreme conditions that would significantly exacerbate the cold.
- Precipitation, specifically snow, is not expected as the chance of snow is 0% throughout the night.

Given these observations and considering the conservative nature of decision-making for snow days:

- The weather does not meet the severities mentioned in the school's snow day criteria, such as dangerous wind chill temperatures, extreme cold, or significant precipitation.
- The moderate winds, while potentially chilly, should not significantly impact road conditions or the physical safety of students and staff.

Thus, the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools, by placing emphasis on the gathered data and the criteria provided, is significantly low. Considering no weather alerts are active and the parameters do not approach critical thresholds, I conservatively estimate the likelihood of a snow day at:

🌨️ Snow Day Chance: 10% 🌞

This prediction holds barring any unforeseen significant changes in weather conditions overnight. Please stay updated with local weather forecasts as situations can evolve.
