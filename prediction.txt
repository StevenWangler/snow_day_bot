Considering the provided snow day criteria and using the analyzed hourly weather data:

- The **Temperature** and **Wind Chill** values do not approach the severe conditions outlined in the criteria. Thus, they do not significantly contribute to the likelihood of a snow day.
- **Wind Speeds** increase overnight but are not coupled with low visibility or heavy precipitation, reducing concern over their impact.
- **Precipitation** consists of patchy rain with a high chance in the early hours, but without snow or freezing rain, the immediate risk to roads and safety seems lower.
- There are no weather alerts specific to the region concerning snow, ice, or severe wind chill conditions.

Following a highly conservative approach, especially noting the absence of extreme cold, snowfall, and severe wind conditions, and considering the district's capacity to handle non-severe weather conditions:

üå®Ô∏è **Snow Day Prediction**: There‚Äôs a minimal chance for a snow day given the mild and non-severe weather conditions, pointing towards regular school operation. Accordingly, the chance for a snow day is estimated at **5%**. This accounts for the presence of patchy rain, which, while noted, does not significantly heighten the likelihood of a snow day absence other severe factors.
