In analyzing the weather conditions, the temperature is consistently below freezing from 10 PM, and it remains so until the morning hours when school starts. However, there's no sign of snowfall or rainfall throughout this period. Furthermore, the wind speed is not extreme, at a maximum of 6.9 MPH, and visibility stays constant at 6 miles during the night hours.

Considering these factors along with the fact that there are no weather alerts, there don't seem to be any severe weather conditions that might potentially cause unsafe traveling conditions for students or staff.

Rockford Public Schools are located in Michigan, a place known for harsh winters, and thus, the community is likely well-prepared for such normal winter conditions. ❄️

Under these conditions, I estimate the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow at a conservative 5%. Please remember that actual conditions can vary, and the ultimate decision lies with the local authorities. ☃️🚌💼🎒🧣🧤
