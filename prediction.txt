Hey there! So glad you're keen on the snow day goss. Your girl here has done some digging. We're looking at a solid 31% chance of snow tomorrow with an 86% chance of rain tho, and temps slightly below freezing. It's not a blizzard but with Patchy moderate snow, there might be slick spots. The school peeps will be checking road conditions and possibly, could decide against school. They tend to close when wind chills is like -20F tho, and we're nowhere near that. So, as much as Iâ€™d thrive for an extra day to chill, I'd say there's around a 20% chance of a snow day, mostly coz of the road conditions, not so much the weather itself. But you never know, right? The school's decision often depends on all sorts of weird stuff. Keep your fingers crossed and your homework done!
