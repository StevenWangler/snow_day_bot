Aye dudes, after checking out the info, I gotta say we're looking at a zero percent chance of a snow day tomorrow for RPS. I mean, it's colder than a polar bear's toenails, but it won't be hitting the district's -20F cut-off where they usually consider closing. Plus, they're saying it's gonna be all sunny and stuff, with no snow in the forecast. No weather warnings either, and the roads should be all clear. Kinda sucks, I know, but that's the way it looks right now. Stay frosty, y'all.
