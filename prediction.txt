🌨️ After evaluating the hourly weather conditions and comparing them to the snow day criteria for Rockford Public Schools, here's the summary:

- **Dangerous Wind Chill:** There were no instances where the wind chill reached the dangerous threshold of -20°F or below. 🌬️
- **Temperature Extremes:** Temperature did not drop to extreme cold levels that would independently warrant a snow day. 🌡️
- **High Wind Speeds:** Winds were consistently strong but did not cross the threshold considered highly impactful for visibility or exacerbating cold conditions. 💨
- **Precipitation:** There was a moment of moderate snow, but overall, precipitation wasn't significant enough to indicate severe snow accumulation that would impact road conditions or safety. 🌨️

Given there are no active, relevant weather alerts and with a very conservative approach to allocating snow days, the likelihood of a snow day primarily hinges on the moderate precipitation early in the period and consistently strong (but not extreme) wind speeds. However, these conditions do not appear to severely impact the roads or temperatures to the extent that would normally trigger a school closure based on the described criteria.

Therefore, considering the observed weather conditions against the school's snow day criteria and keeping a conservative stance, I predict a **20% chance** of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools. This low percentage reflects the absence of critical thresholds being met for the most impactful criteria such as dangerous wind chill, extreme temperatures, high winds, or heavy precipitation. Stay warm and safe! ❄️📚
