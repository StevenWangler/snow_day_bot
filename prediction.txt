Yo, check it - no way we're having a snow day at Rockford tomorrow, I'm sayin' 0% chance. Hereâ€™s the deets: the temp's gonna be above freezing point, and even though it's January, it's gonna be sunny and dry with no snowfall or rain. Also, our school officials drive around to check the road conditions, and with zero prep, that's gonna be a smooth ride, my dude. So, keep those textbooks handy 'cause class is absolutely on!
