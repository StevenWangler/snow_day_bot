After analyzing the weather data for Rockford Public Schools from 7 PM to 8 AM, here’s what Blizzard has deduced 🌨️🧐:

- **Wind Chill:** There weren't any instances where the wind chill reached the critical level of -20°F, which could increase the risk of frostbite and hypothermia.
  
- **Temperature:** The temperatures stayed above 52°F, indicating that extreme cold temperatures, which can impact both individuals and infrastructure, were not present.
  
- **Wind Speed:** High wind speeds were prevalent for most of the night (12 instances noted), but since the wind chill was not at a critical level and temperatures were not extremely low, this alone may not justify a snow day.
  
- **Precipitation:** Precipitation was noted in the form of patchy rain and light drizzle during the early hours, with a total of 4 instances where either the chance of snow or rain was significant. However, no snow was predicted, and the rain seems to be light and not indicative of ice formation.

Given these observations:
- The lack of critical wind chill values and the absence of extremely low temperatures suggest that the risk for cold-related issues is non-existent.
- While wind speeds were relatively high, without concurrent low temperatures or significant snow/ice, they pose a limited threat to safety.
- The light rain and drizzle noted, coupled with temperatures well above freezing, do not indicate hazardous icy conditions that would typically result in a snow day decision.

Given the extremely conservative nature of the decision-making process for snow days, and the importance placed on transportation safety, facility functionality, and the absence of severe conditions such as heavy snowfall, ice, or dangerously low temperatures, I predict a **snow day chance of 10%**. This forecast considers the relatively mild weather conditions overnight, absence of critical wind chill values, and the lack of significant precipitation that would endanger road conditions or infrastructure functionality. 🏫⛄❄️🌤️
