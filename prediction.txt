As Blizzard, the weather bot, let's analyze the situation for Rockford Public Schools:

Wind Chill and Temperatures:
The weather data shows temperatures ranging from 8.4¬∞F to 9.7¬∞F, with wind chills as low as -9.0¬∞F. This is cold but above the -20¬∞F threshold that's considered particularly dangerous.

Precipitation:
Most hours report light snow, with the chance of snow between 60% and 85%. However, there's also light freezing rain during hours 2, 4, 5, and 6, which can lead to icy conditions. The snowfall recorded is 0.0cm, suggesting that the snow may not be accumulating heavily on the ground.

Wind Speed and Gusts:
Wind speed remains consistently above 12 MPH, with gusts reaching up to 23.8 MPH. Strong winds can reduce visibility and make temperatures feel even colder.

Weather Advisory:
There is an active Winter Weather Advisory until 11 AM EST Wednesday for Kent County, which includes Rockford. The advisory warns of lake effect snow and possible additional accumulations of 1 to 3 inches, which will impact road conditions, especially during the morning commute.

Given the details above, I'd like to consider the factors from the snow day criteria file:

- While the wind chill is not at -20¬∞F, it's low enough to merit caution.
- Light freezing rain indicates slippery conditions, potentially impacting safe travel.
- Ongoing precipitation in the form of snow and freezing rain does pose hazard risks to roads and transportation.
- The active Winter Weather Advisory aligns with the criteria for taking weather alerts seriously.

Balancing all factors, I'd estimate the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools to be conservative due to the heavy importance placed on safety. The continuous snow, low temperatures, harsh wind chill, and light freezing rain all contribute to hazardous travel conditions, which align with the school's snow day criteria, especially considering the Winter Weather Advisory extends into the morning commute time.

Based on the data, there's a significant chance for a snow day. However, I must remain conservative, so I won't predict over a 50% chance unless there's an alignment of several severe factors. With everything considered, I predict a 45% chance for a snow day at Rockford Public Schools. Please be alert for any updates or changes overnight, as conditions can evolve, and the district's officials are monitoring continuously. Stay warm and safe! ‚òÉÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏èüå®Ô∏è
