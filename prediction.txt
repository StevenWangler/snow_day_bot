The weather data for Rockford Public Schools from 7 PM to 8 AM shows a progression from partly cloudy conditions with temperatures around the freezing point early in the evening to significantly more severe weather conditions overnight. Specifically:

- Early hours (7 PM - 2 AM): Conditions are partly cloudy to overcast, with temperatures gradually decreasing but remaining above critical levels. There's no precipitation.
- Middle to Late hours (3 AM - 8 AM): Conditions deteriorate significantly:
  - **3 AM**: begins with light freezing rain at a temperature of 28.0°F.
  - **4 AM**: transitions to light snow with a slight accumulation (0.03cm).
  - **5 AM to 7 AM**: heavy snow starts, significantly impacting visibility (reduced to 1.0 mile) with more substantial snowfall accumulation (up to 1.66cm at 6 AM).

Considering the school's snow day criteria, particularly the importance of wind chill, precipitation, and their effects on road conditions and infrastructure, here are key findings:
- **Wind Chill and Temperature**: Although the temperature and wind chill are not extreme (-20°F or lower as highlighted in the criteria), they do fall to the low 20s°F, indicating cold but not extreme conditions.
- **Precipitation**: The heavy snowfall starting at 5 AM, with rapid accumulation and 100% chance of snow, denotes significant impact likely on road conditions and safe travel.
- **Visibility**: The drop to 1.0 mile at 5 AM, coupled with heavy snow, indicates potential hazards for morning commutes.

Given these observations, while there are no weather alerts to consider, the conditions significantly worsen overnight with heavy snow, likely affecting roads and transportation crucial for a school day's safe operation.

Based on the extremely conservative superintendent mentality, coupled with appreciable snow accumulation and visibility concerns critical hours before school begins, I estimate the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools at **70%**. This assessment considers the school's criteria emphasizing safety and infrastructure impacts without extreme wind chill or temperature but noting the transition to hazardous weather conditions overnight.
