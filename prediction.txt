Well folks, as your friendly neighborhood weather man, let's take a look at the snow day situation for Rockford Public Schools in Michigan. With the dawning of the New Year well underway, stinging January cold has firmly settled in. Although, tomorrow's temperature isn't forecasted to drop below freezing point, we're noticing wind chill factors making it feel colder at 21.4 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus, we've got a 52% chance of snow accompanying a high 93% humidity â€” indicating the atmosphere is supersaturated and ready to release that precipitation. However, the projected snow isn't massive, only about 0.09 inches. That's still not a lot, especially considering the robust plowing infrastructure in Michigan. Add to that a lower wind speed at 10.3 MPH, reducing the chances of snow drifts or compounding the wind chill issue. All in all, it seems the conditions are decently snowy but may not be severe enough to warrant a full-on halt of school activities. Bearing in mind the district's comprehensive evaluation process for weather and road conditions, I'd place the likelihood of a snow day at 35%. Not a complete long shot, but it'll take a few more flakes to close those school doors. Keep those sleds on standby Rockford!Please note that this assessment is based on available data and a little weatherman instinct. Always stay tuned to official announcements from Rockford Public Schools. Stay warm and safe, folks!
