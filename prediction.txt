Hey dudes! So here's the deal: there's a solid 0% chance of us getting a snow day tomorrow at Rockford Public. Why you ask? Well, check this out - the forecast for tomorrow is all sun and no snow or rain. Zip. Nada. It's gonna be a bit chilly, like 25.6 Fahrenheit kinda chilly, but not the "turn your snot into ice" negative 20 kinda cold we need to close school. No weather alerts for Kent County either, which is a bummer too. So, yea, no need to dream of sleeping in or having an awesome snowball fight. It's just another sunny day in Michigan. But hey, chin up, there's always another chance for a little winter miracle later right? Peace out!
