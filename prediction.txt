After analyzing the hourly weather data for Rockford Public Schools, here are the key findings:

- The minimum temperature observed was 29.0Â°F, with the minimum "feels like" temperature dropping to 19.6Â°F due to wind chill. Although cold, these temperatures are considerably above the -20Â°F wind chill threshold that is of particular concern for safety.
- Snowfall was observed with a total accumulation of 0.3cm during the hour with heavy snow conditions. While this indicates a brief period of heavy snow, the overall accumulation is minimal.
- The maximum wind speed reached was 16.6MPH. High wind speeds can exacerbate the feeling of cold and can impact visibility along with snow, but no sustained blizzard conditions were reported.
- The average visibility was approximately 5.8 miles, slightly reduced but not critically low. Reduced visibility was primarily during the hour of heavy snow.

Given the criteria for a snow day at Rockford Public Schools, focusing on severe cold (including wind chill), significant snowfall or ice accumulation, and the impact on transportation and infrastructure, the weather conditions, while cold with a brief heavy snow event, do not seem to significantly exceed thresholds that would typically warrant a snow day. Considering the conservative approach in predicting snow days and the absence of extreme weather alerts:

ðŸŒ¨ Snow Day Prediction: 20% chance ðŸŒ¨

This cautious percentage reflects the briefly challenging conditions overnight but takes into account that temperatures, overall snow accumulation, and visibility are not severely adverse. The forecast suggests that while students and staff should prepare for cold conditions, a snow day might not be necessary. Safety measures and close monitoring of any changes in weather conditions overnight are recommended.
