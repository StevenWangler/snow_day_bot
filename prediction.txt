After analyzing the weather conditions from 7 PM to 8 AM for Rockford Public Schools, here's what I found:

- The lowest temperature recorded was 35.3°F, and the coldest wind chill was 29.2°F.
- The highest wind speed was 12.5 MPH, but visibility dropped to a minimum of 2.0 miles at one point.
- There were no instances of snow or alerts indicating severe weather conditions affecting Kent county.

Given these observations, and aligning with the conservative nature of superintendents when determining snow days, we do not have extreme weather conditions that would typically trigger a snow day, based on the established criteria. The temperatures and wind chill values, while cold, are not at extremely hazardous levels. Additionally, without significant precipitation or severe weather alerts, road and transportation conditions are expected to remain manageable.

Considering all factors and the lack of snowfall or dangerous wind chill levels, I estimate the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools to be at a very low level. 

🌨️ Snow Day Chance: 10% 🌨️

This prediction is made with caution, prioritizing student safety but also acknowledging the current weather data does not typically warrant a closure based on the provided snow day criteria.
