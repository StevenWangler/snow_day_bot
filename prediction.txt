After analyzing the hourly weather data for Rockford Public Schools, here are the key findings:

- **Accumulated Snowfall:** A total of 0.05 cm of snowfall was observed. 🌨
- **Wind Chill:** The data provided does not show a wind chill value lower than 0°F, implying that the lowest feels-like temperature was higher than this threshold. 🌬️
- **Precipitation Occurrences:** There were 4 instances where either the chance of snow was over 50% or conditions of light freezing rain or light snow were reported. ☔️
- **Max Wind Speed:** The highest wind speed observed was 13.9 MPH. 💨

Given these insights and applying the extremely conservative criteria for Rockford Public Schools:

- The **accumulated snowfall** is minimal and unlikely to significantly impact road conditions or infrastructure.
- **Wind chill** values, while chilly, do not approach the critical -20°F threshold that would heighten concern for frostbite or hypothermia.
- **Precipitation occurrences** signal temporary periods of snow and freezing rain, but without significant accumulation or continual severe weather, the risk to transportation and infrastructure is likely manageable.
- The **max wind speed**, although notable, does not reach a level where visibility and travel would be severely compromised, especially given the minimal snowfall amounts seen.

🔍 Based on the provided data and closely adhering to the conservative snow day criteria:

- The relatively low snowfall,
- Absence of severe wind chill values,
- Manageable precipitation occurrences, and
- Moderate wind speed

together suggest that while weather conditions may require caution, they do not strongly justify a snow day under the school's conservative threshold.

Therefore, considering all factors with a conservative approach, I would predict a **20% chance of a snow day** for Rockford Public Schools. Remember, safety is paramount, so regardless of predictions, always check the latest local weather updates and school communications. Stay warm and safe! ❄️📚
