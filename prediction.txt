Yo, what's up! Given that temps are chilly, but the skies are gonna be all sunny and stuff tomorrow, with no ice or frost in sight, we're lookin' at a 0% chance of a snow day, dawg. Seriously, zero. Nada. Zilch. To top it off, ain't got no weather alerts or warnings on the radar, either. So, you're probably gonna need to set that alarm and hit the books again tomorrow. Might wanna bundle up though, 'cause it's gonna be pretty frosty out there. Peace out!
