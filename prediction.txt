Well folks, grab a warm cup of coffee and tune into this little weather update. Now, as we swirl our keen eye around the atmospheric conditions of our beloved Rockford Public Schools for tomorrow, the chances look rather slim for a snow day. With the mercury set to hover between 31.9 and 35.5 degrees Fahrenheit, it's a little nippy but not enough to turn the area into a winter wonderland. Add to that a marginal wind speed of 12.5MPH making 'feels like' temperature to be around 28.9 degrees Fahrenheit, it's going to be a chilly day, but not one for snowmen. The skies are keeping mum, with just a 3% chance of a white blanket outcome. The humidity is on the higher side, at 81%, but that tight-lipped precipitation resting at .0 inches isn't giving us any hints either. Frankly speaking, snow day enthusiasts may want to brace themselves for some disappointment. After crunching these fine atmospheric details, I'd argue that the snow day probability is sitting right around a frosty 3%. Bundle up and get ready for class, because school is certainly looking likely tomorrow. Over and out!
