Yo, so here's the lowdown - tomorrow's looking pretty chill, but not like, snow day chill. The temps are gonna be below freezing, but the precipitation's at a big fat 0%. Sun's out too, dude, so that's nice, right? So, if we're keeping it 100, it's super unlikely we're having a snow day. I'd say the chances are at a smooth 0%. Superintendent's got a lot on his plate, but I don't think snow is gonna be one of 'em, ya dig? So keep those textbooks handy, 'cause school's most likely on.
