Hey dude, the chances of a snow day for Rockford are looking like a solid 0%. Yeah, sounds lame, I know. But despite it being January in Michigan, the weather for tomorrow is looking pretty boring with sunny conditions, no precipitation, and temperatures well above the closing point. Plus, no weather alerts for Kent County and 0% chance for either snow or rain. So, we'll have to ride the early bus, brave those sub-zero wind chills, and take those annoying quizzes. Better luck next time, dude. Shred the day anyway!
