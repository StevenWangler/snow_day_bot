**Analysis:**
Given the stable temperatures well above freezing, lack of precipitation, and wind speeds that do not pose significant wind chill threat, there is no immediate weather hazard as per the school's snow day criteria. The criteria emphasize the importance of severe cold, substantial wind chill, and hazardous road conditions primarily due to precipitation, none of which are present based on the provided forecast.

Furthermore, there are no active weather alerts for Kent county which would suggest an upcoming significant weather event that might impact the school day. The warnings and observations are critical for conservative decision-making regarding school closures, specifically for Rockford Public Schools, which emphasizes dynamic decision-making and careful consideration of local conditions.

**Snow Day Prediction:**
Given the above considerations and embracing the conservative outlook stressed by Rockford Public Schools, it appears there are no significant weather-related disruptions expected. Therefore, the likelihood of a snow day solely based on the current weather data and forecasts stands at a very low probability.
