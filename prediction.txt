Hey dude, so checking out the weather and all that jazz for Rockford Public Schools, doesn't look like we're gonna catch that snow day tomorrow. Nada snow. With the min temp chilling around 34.4 and going up to 40 degrees, and a heavy downpour expected instead of snowflakes, it's looking like a typical wet December day. So my guestimate would be a solid 0% chance. Don't forget your umbrella and maybe wear those waterproof shoes, yeah?
