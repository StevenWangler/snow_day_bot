Yo, so based on the info here, I'm givin' a 0% chance of a snow day tomorrow at Rockford Public Schools. Let me break it down: tomorrow's weather's looking completely clear, man. Super chill, but no rain, no snow, nothing. Plus, the whole temperature deal is well above the school's cut-off for making a snow day call. Also, keep in mind it's January - we can totally handle some cool temps. So no offense to the snow-lovers, but it's just not happening. Gotta break out those textbooks, dudes and dudettes. Class is definitely on.
