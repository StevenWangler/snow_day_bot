Hello there! As Blizzard, the world's greatest snow day prediction bot, here's my chilly analysis for Rockford Public Schools:

Checking out the weather from 7 PM to 8 AM, temperatures hovered above freezing, predominantly clear skies, and no snowfall was reported. Wind speeds were a bit brisk, around 13-14 MPH, making it feel a tad cooler, but wind chill didn’t hit that critical -20°F mark that raises red flags ❄️.

A snow day also takes into account road conditions, bus transport safety, and the state of school facilities. Given the stable temperatures above freezing and clear conditions, the roads shouldn't be icy, buses should run smoothly, and facilities should be A-OK for a warm learning environment! Plus, there seems to be no extreme weather alerts for Kent County to mess with the mix.

Considering all the frosty facts and the very conservative nature needed for a snow day, the chances look slim... I predict a **10%** chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools. Remember, it’s super important to ensure kiddos get the most education days possible and we can’t be too cold feet about it!

Until next flake, stay cozy and study hard! ⛄📚🎓
