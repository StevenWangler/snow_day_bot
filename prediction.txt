- **Wind Chill:** -20°F or below is critical due to increased frostbite and hypothermia risk.
- **Temperature:** Extremely cold temperatures can affect health and infrastructure.
- **Wind Speed:** Higher speeds worsen cold effects and can impact visibility with snowfall.
- **Precipitation:** Amount and rate (snow, sleet, freezing rain) affect travel safety and road conditions.
- Weather forecast accuracy and the impact on transportation and infrastructure (roads, buses, school facilities) are crucial. Decisions are dynamically made based on forecast and actual weather conditions till the early morning.

Given these criteria, let's analyze the hourly weather data provided for Rockford Public Schools to predict the chance of a snow day tomorrow.
