Hey dude, looking at all this chilly info, and checking out the school's Snow Day policy (which seems pretty thorough, btw), I think we’re definitely stuck hitting the books tomorrow. The temperature tomorrow may be cold, but it’s not snowing or raining, and the humidity isn't even that high. Plus, the weather is supposed to be sunny. So, I’d say the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow? Absolutely 0%. Better start on that homework, pal.
