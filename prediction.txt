After correcting the data and conducting an analysis based on the criteria for Rockford Public Schools, here's what I've found:

- **Average Temperature:** 26.82°F
- **Average Wind Speed:** 3.38MPH
- **Maximum Wind Speed:** 9.4MPH
- **Average Feels Like Temperature:** 23.67°F
- **Minimum Feels Like Temperature:** 21.1°F

Considering the snow day criteria:
- There is no snowfall reported.
- Although temperatures are cold, none dropped below the particularly dangerous wind chill threshold of -20°F mentioned in the snow day criteria.
- Wind speeds are moderate with the highest being 9.4MPH, which does not significantly impact safety based on the provided criteria.
- Visibility issues or severe weather conditions like freezing rain or heavy snow are not present.

Given these observations and maintaining the conservative nature expected by superintendents in decision-making, the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools under these conditions appears to be low. Coupled with no active weather alerts for Kent County and the apparent stability in weather conditions, a significant disruption to school operations seems unlikely.

Therefore, the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is estimated to be **10%**. It's important for both students and staff to prepare for regular school activities tomorrow, keeping in mind to dress warmly due to the cold temperatures. Stay cozy, Rockford! 🌡️❄️📚
