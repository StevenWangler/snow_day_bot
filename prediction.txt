Apologies for the hiccup. According to the provided weather data, the chance of a snow day happening tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools is 0%. 🌨

Here's the summarization of my findings:

1. No snow is expected between 7 PM and 8 AM. ❄️
2. Temperatures are above the freezing point, posing no icy road threats. 🌡️
3. Visibility is good, so it's safe on the roads. 🚗
4. No weather alerts have been issued for Kent County, where the school is located. ⚠️

The school day tomorrow should proceed without any weather-related interruptions. I recommend students to studied for any tests they might have tomorrow and teachers to be prepared for the full day of classes. 🎒

Remember, weather forecasting is not an exact science and situations can change unexpectedly. Always stay updated with official weather updates. Stay safe! ⛄️🧣🧤
