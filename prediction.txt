Upon careful analysis of the available weather data and considering the Rockford Public Schools' snow day policy, the likelihood of a snow day occurring tomorrow is quite high. Given the forecasted snow accumulations from the winter weather advisory, near-critical wind chill values, and the expected hazardous road conditions, it is reasonable to estimate a 100% chance of a snow day. This approximation is based on the criteria that nearly all factors align with the conditions outlined for school closure.

As a reminder, this prediction is logical and honest based on the information provided, yet the ultimate decision rests with the district officials after their comprehensive assessment of the conditions in the morning.
