Yo, listen up. We're looking at a 0% chance of a snow day tomorrow for Rockford. Now, I know that Michigan weather can be a wild card, but with tomorrow's forecast showing sunny skies, temperatures in the 20s and 30s, zero indication of snow or rain, and relatively low wind chill and wind speed, it's not looking likely. There's no forecasted precipitation and the humidity is dropping. Plus, there are no weather alerts on the radar for Kent County. Remember, the school checks out the wind chill, precipitation and road conditions before making a call. In this case, there's no strong reason for a snow day. Bummer, I know, but at least we won't freeze our tails off! Keep those books handy.
