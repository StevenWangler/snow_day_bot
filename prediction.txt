Well folks, pull out those winter coats and mittens because we're in for some frosty conditions tomorrow in the Rockford Public School District. Considering the incoming blizzard with a whopping 60% chance of snowfall and 75% chances of rain, we're seeing a high likelihood of slippery roads and hazardous travel conditions. Taking into account the school's snow policy that places high emphasis on the safety of students' commute, the heavy snowfall warning from our weather alert, and bearing in mind the Superintendent's recent decision-making in similar weather scenarios... I'm giving us about an 85% chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow. This is largely informed by a combination of predicted severe weather and the school's commitment to student safety. So, kids, there might just be some extra time for sledding tomorrow. Until then, stay warm and safe out there Rockford!
