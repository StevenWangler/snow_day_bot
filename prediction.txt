To assess the likelihood of a snow day occurring tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools, we apply a rigorous scientific analysis based on the presented meteorological data and the operational protocols typically used by educational institutions to determine school closures.

The forecasted hourly conditions between 7 PM and 8 AM indicate consistent temperatures well below the freezing mark, ranging from 7.4°F to 9.8°F, with corresponding wind chills reaching as low as -8.4°F. The cloud cover remains at 100% throughout the night, with high humidity levels (91% to 95%), suggesting a conducive environment for sustained snowfall. The probability of snow remains high, between 61% and 100%, and there is a constant threat of light to moderate snow showers, although actual snowfall amounts are recorded at 0.0cm during these hours. Nonetheless, visibility is affected, dropping to as low as 3.0 miles during periods of moderate snow.

Additionally, there is a Winter Weather Advisory in effect until 4 PM EST Monday, with anticipated snow accumulations of 2 to 6 inches in the region encompassing Rockford and surroundings. Conditions point to slippery road conditions and reduced visibility due to areas of blowing snow.

Given the persistent conditions conducive to snowfall, active Winter Weather Advisory, and the significant impact anticipated on road conditions, we estimate there is a substantial likelihood of a snow day. Integrating the meteorological data with the potential for hazardous travel conditions and school operational standards, we project a 75% chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow.

This estimate factors in the historical thresholds for snow day declarations, considering visibility, actual and forecasted snow accumulations, temperature, wind chill, and local weather advisories. However, the final decision resides with the school district authorities who will take into account additional localized information and logistics that may adjust this estimation.
