After meticulously analyzing the provided weather data, I predict a 10% chance of a snow day tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools. 🌤📚🎒

This is predominantly due to the consistent sub-freezing temperatures predicted throughout the night and morning, which could likely harden any residual moisture on the roads and pose a minor safety concern. However, as no snow or rain is anticipated and visibility is expected to stay clear, the overall conditions seem quite favorable for regular school operations. Remember, these predictions can change with any significant shifts in weather conditions. ALWAYS check the latest weather updates before heading out. ☃️🔍 Stay safe and warm, folks! 😊🧣🧤📚
