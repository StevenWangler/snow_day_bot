After meticulously analyzing the hourly weather data for Rockford Public Schools from 7 PM to 8 AM and taking the snow day criteria into careful consideration, it appears that the conditions, although chilly, do not strongly align with the critical factors for calling a snow day. The temperature remains relatively mild without dipping to extreme cold levels, and while there's some precipitation, it doesn't transition into heavy snow or ice that could severely impact road conditions or transportation safety.

Given these observations and maintaining the conservative approach as per the school's guidelines, the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is assessed at a 20% chance. Brrr, it's a bit cold, but keep those pencils sharpened and backpacks ready! 🌨️📚✏️
