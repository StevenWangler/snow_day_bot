Well folks, if we gaze into the crystal ball of meteorology for tomorrow's forecast in Rockford, it's looking a bit blustery, I must admit. With a 74% chance of snowfall and a 77% chance of rain, it's quite a mixed bag we have coming our way in Michigan! Temperatures will be borderline freezing with pretty heavy snow predicted. Considering the Rockford Public School District's approach to snow days, particularly their dependency on temperature, wind chill, wind speed and precipitation, as well as road conditions, this isn't something to take lightly. Taking into account the district's policy of closing schools when the wind chill is a sustained -20F or colder, tomorrow’s wind chill of 20.8 isn’t quite falling within that critical yardstick. However, it's the high chance for both snow and rain combined with the predicted wind speed and accumulation that might sway the odds. Given this forecast, it reveals a bit of a slippery picture - and not just on the ice! By weaving all these weather threads together, I'd put the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow at about 70%. Keep those snow boots and sleds at the ready, kids, but also don't forget about your homework just in case!
