Chill, dudes and dudettes! We're looking at a solid 0% chance of a snow day for our fair Rockford Public Schools tomorrow. Yeah, it's Michigan in January and today's weather has been aggro with that freezing rain, but the forecast for tomorrow is totally sunny with no chance for nothin' - rain, snow, nada. It's gonna be a bit chilly, but nothing our Michigander fortitude can't handle. Plus, no weather alerts in sight, so looks like we're cruising in clear skies, amigos. Time to hit those books!
