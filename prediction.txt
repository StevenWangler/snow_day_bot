Yo, looking at all this weather data, I'd say the chances of us getting a snow day tomorrow is probably a solid 0%. It's gonna be cold for sure, like always, but no snow or even any rain is expected. The schools only close when there's a bunch of snow or the wind chill hits -20F and tomorrow's forecast doesn't match with those conditions. So, expect to hit the books tomorrow, folks. Stay cool!
