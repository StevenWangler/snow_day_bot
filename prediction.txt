The average risk score based on the analysis of the provided hourly weather data is approximately 6.16, which falls into the "high risk" category (above 6) according to our established parameters.

However, this score is heavily influenced by the rain and wind, and while these factors will certainly make the commute more difficult, they don't necessarily mean a snow day is warranted. Given that there isn't any forecast of snow and the temperature will not be dropping below freezing, it doesn't appear that the school would be justified in calling a snow day.

Therefore, considering the conservative superintendent mentality and given there are no severe weather alerts, ice, or snow forecast, the risk of a snow day remains quite low.

Despite the "high risk" score, I would estimate the likelihood of a snow day at **20%**. This is due to the combination of high wind speeds and persistent heavy rainfall that could compromise road conditions, particularly for buses. Please note, if road conditions are reported as unsafe due to local flooding or wind damage, the chances of a snow day would increase.

Stay warm and keep those raincoats handy! ☔🧥🌧️💨🌚🚌🚸🌃🌜⛈️📚
