After analyzing the hourly weather data for Rockford Public Schools, here are some key observations:

- The average temperature from 7 PM to 8 AM is approximately 39.6°F, with the "feels like" temperature averaging around 33.6°F. 
- The average wind speed during this period is about 9.1MPH.
- The visibility stays relatively clear, with an average of around 5.8 miles.

With the provided snow day criteria referencing wind chill as a significant factor (specifically mentioning a concern at -20°F, far colder than the observed temperatures), and considering the wind speed, visibility, and lack of snow or icy precipitation, the weather conditions don't seem severe enough to warrant a high likelihood of a snow day based on the very conservative superintendent mentality.

Given these observations and the absence of active weather alerts for Kent County, the chance for a snow day for Rockford Public Schools tomorrow seems to be quite low. 🌨️

Snow Day Chance: **5%**

This low percentage is attributed to the overall mild weather conditions during the critical overnight and early morning hours before school starts. Stay warm and safe, and be prepared for school tomorrow! 📚
