After examining the weather data and the snow day policy for Rockford Public Schools, I've determined that there is a 25% chance of a snow day. While the Dense Fog Advisory is in effect and could contribute to hazardous driving conditions due to low visibility, the other factors such as temperature, wind chill, and lack of significant snowfall do not strongly support a high likelihood of school closure. Stay warm and safe out there! ☁️📉🧊🏫🚌🌡️🔍
