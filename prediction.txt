After analyzing the provided hourly weather data, here are the key findings:

- The **average temperature** during the nightly hours leading up to school hours is **51.1Â°F**, which is above freezing, making significant snowfall or ice accumulation unlikely.
- The **average wind speed** is **17.8MPH**, indicating relatively strong winds but not necessarily reaching thresholds that would in themselves cause school closures due to cold exposure or visibility issues.
- There is a consistent pattern of **rain**, with **8 out of the 13 hours** showing a **100% chance of precipitation**. This indicates a substantial amount of rain leading up to the school hours.

Considering the **Rockford Public Schools' criteria** for a snow day, especially under a conservative approach:
- The **temperature** remains well above freezing throughout the night, negating the risk of icy conditions that would warrant a snow day based on freezing temperatures alone.
- Despite **continuous rain**, without dropping temperatures below freezing, the primary concern would be wet rather than icy or snowy roads. However, conditions such as **re-freezing** with any slight temperature drops post-rain or early in the morning could pose a risk.
- **Wind speeds** are high but without snow or freezing temperatures, the direct impact on safety, in terms of cold exposure or significant snow drifts blocking routes, is reduced.

Given these observations and applying a very conservative superintendent's perspective, the likelihood of a snow day primarily rests on the potential for re-freezing conditions and not on snow accumulation or extreme cold exposure.

However, we have:
- No active, relevant weather alerts indicating severe conditions for the next school day.
- Temperatures that, while decreasing, haven't been shown to reach or flirt with freezing marks consistently across the data.

Thereby, calculating the likelihood of a snow day, considering the rain, wind, and conservative nature against the backdrop of the criteria given and no severe weather alerts, we must be prudent.

Given these considerations:
- The chance for hazardous ice on roads exists but is not confirmed due to temperatures staying mostly above freezing.
- Persistent rain could lead to potential minor flooding or problematic wet conditions but isn't enough on its own for a closure.

Therefore, taking a measured and data-driven approach respecting the conservative standard set by superintendents for snow days, the likelihood of declaring a snow day seems quite low. ðŸŒ¨ðŸ“š
