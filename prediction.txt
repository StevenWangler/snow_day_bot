To predict the likelihood of a snow day occurring tomorrow at the Rockford Public Schools located in Michigan, I shall analyze the data collected from the hourly weather conditions between 7 PM and 8 AM and interpret the information provided from the Winter Weather Advisory.

Let us examine the critical weather parameters:

1. **Temperature**: With hourly temperatures well below freezing point (ranging from 8.3°F to 10.6°F) and with a negative wind chill value, the conditions are certainly conducive for snow to accumulate rather than melt.
2. **Chance of Snow**: The probabilities range from 52% to 100% throughout the night, which is an indicator of persistent snowfall.
3. **Visibility and Wind Speed**: With visibility reduced significantly to 3 or 4 miles, and winds speeds between 10.7 to 13.0 MPH causing gusts up to 20.2 MPH, travel could be hazardous.
4. **Weather Advisory**: The current advisory indicates that the region is experiencing lake effect snow with additional accumulations expected. This suggests ongoing snowfall, though the severity is indicated as minor.
5. **Snow Accumulation**: It's specified that there is an expected accumulation of 2 to 6 inches of snow, though the hourly data indicates no additional snowfall (0.0cm).
6. **Time and Duration**: The weather advisory is in effect until 4 PM EST Monday, which overlaps with school hours.

Taking into account these meteorological factors and the existing winter weather advisory indicating slippery road conditions and reduced visibility due to lake effect snow, one can reasonably predict there is an elevated probability for a snow day due to accumulated snowfall affecting transportation and the safety of commuting to school.

Considering the certainty of these conditions as described by the meteorological data and advisory, alongside the typical thresholds and policies for school closures due to weather for the region, I estimate there is approximately a **70% chance** of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools. This forecast is subject to change with new weather data and decisions made by school authorities based on safety considerations.
