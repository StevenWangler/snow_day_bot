Hey there! So here's the deal, with the temps the way they are - somewhere between downright chilly and frostbite-inducing - tomorrow isn't looking too wintry for Michigan in January. There's a teeny 4% chance of snow. Yeah, that's right, only 4%. Rockford Public Schools have a serious operation when it comes to deciding Snow Days, you know - monitoring everything from the wind chill to road conditions, and even driving around to check things up close. But without a heavy blast of the white stuff I don't see it happening. So, my dudes and dudettes, brace yourselves for school tomorrow, 'cause the chance for a snow day? I'd put it at 0%.
