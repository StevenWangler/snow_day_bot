After analyzing the provided weather data for Rockford Public Schools from 7 PM to 8 AM, here's what I found:

- The **lowest temperature** recorded was 30.6Â°F, which is significantly above the critical -20Â°F concerning wind chill.
- The **highest wind speed** observed was 9.4 MPH, which is not high enough to significantly influence the wind chill factor to dangerous levels.
- Visibility remained fairly consistent at **6.0 miles**, suggesting no major impairment due to weather conditions.
- Importantly, there was **no precipitation, including snowfall**, during this period.
- The **lowest "feels like" temperature** was noted as 23.6Â°F, which, while cold, does not reach the extreme cold temperatures that could warrant a snow day.

Given these observations and the very conservative nature of predicting snow days, where conditions must clearly justify closing schools, the forecast for Rockford Public Schools does not support a significant risk of hard impacts that could lead to a snow day. Key factors like extreme cold temperatures (both actual and wind chill), significant snowfall, or other hazardous conditions that could impair transportation and safety are not observed in the data provided. 

Therefore, considering the careful and conservative criteria for a snow day, along with the weather conditions presented, the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools appears to be very low under the observed conditions. 

**Chance of a Snow Day: 0%**
