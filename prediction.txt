After assessing the weather data for Rockford Public Schools from 7 PM to 8 AM:

- The **lowest temperature** observed was **28.7Â°F**, well above the critical -20Â°F referenced in the snow day criteria for wind chill concern.
- The **highest wind speed** noted was **6.3MPH**, indicating moderate winds that are unlikely to significantly impact visibility or exacerbate the cold to dangerous levels.
- The **average wind chill** across all hours was approximately **25.0Â°F**, indicating a consistently cold but not extreme condition according to the criteria provided.

Given the weather conditions involve no precipitation, moderate to low wind speeds, and temperatures along with wind chills that, while cold, do not reach the critical thresholds for snow day consideration, the likelihood for a snow day seems low. Absence of severe weather alerts and conditions that do not significantly threaten transportation or safety, align with a conservative approach to avoid unnecessary school closures.

Based on this data-driven analysis and keeping in mind the extremely conservative superintendent mentality regarding snow day decisions:

ðŸŒ¨ Snow Day Likelihood: **10%**

The rationale behind this percentage: despite the cold, conditions do not severely impact road safety, visibility, or pose an immediate risk to students and staff that would justify closing schools under the strict criteria provided. Given these conditions, and without any significant precipitation or more severe weather alerts, it would be prudent for school operations to proceed with caution, but likely without the need for a snow day.
