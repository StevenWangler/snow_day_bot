Listen up, fam, here's the lowdown - don't dust off your sledges just yet. I mean, we're talking a big, fat 0% chance of a snow day tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools. The high tomorrow is over 40 degrees and, sure, the humidity is hitting a gnarly 90%, but it ain't gonna drop snow with that temperature. Maybe you'll need an umbrella with that 87% rain chance, but ain't no snow happening, my dudes. So pack up those books and set that alarm, school's definitely on. Bummer, right?
