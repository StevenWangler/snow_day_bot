Based on the weather data from 7 PM to 8 AM:

- Temperature Range: The average temperature is approximately 9.4°F, with temperatures remaining consistently low throughout the night. The lowest actual temperature recorded is 7.7°F at 7 AM.
- Feels Like and Wind Chill: The coldest 'feels like' temperature, including wind chill, reaches as low as -7.5°F around 7 AM.
- Snowfall Intensity: There is a notable increase in the chance of snow from 0% at 7 PM to 100% between 2 AM to 6 AM, with an average chance of snow across the night being around 70.8%. However, there is no recorded snowfall (0.0cm) during these hours.
- Wind Speed: Gusts peak at 17.1MPH, with maximum sustained wind speed recorded at 11.9MPH.
- Visibility: On average, visibility is around 4.2 miles, which is reduced substantially during periods of moderate snow, indicating possible poor driving conditions.

Taking all this into consideration:

- Wind Chill: The wind chill factor is significant, and although it hasn't reached the critical -20°F threshold mentioned in the snow day criteria, it is uncomfortably cold, which is a major consideration, especially for students waiting for buses and walking to school.
- Snowfall: The high chance of snow and actual reports of moderate snow during the early morning hours indicate conditions that could impact road safety, a critical aspect for school buses and other transportation.

Despite these concerns, there is no actual snowfall reported, the temperatures do not hit the explicit -20°F danger zone, and the Winter Weather Advisory is due to expire at 4 PM this afternoon, which predates the next school day.

Considering these factors and adhering to the instruction of not predicting a snow day chance higher than 50% without an active weather alert, the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is estimated at a conservative 45%. This percentage takes into account the potential for icy roads and low visibility, along with the uncomfortably low wind chills. However, the decision ultimately rests with school officials who may consider additional factors beyond the weather data presented here. Snow day decisions are often complex and can involve dynamic assessments of weather, infrastructure, and transportation concerns. ❄️🏫📉
