After comparing the weather data against the snow day criteria for Rockford Public Schools, here's what I've observed:

- **Temperature and Wind Chill**: The temperatures throughout the night are within the low 20s (¬∞F), with wind chill values dropping as low as 14.4¬∞F. Although cold, these values are significantly above the critical -20¬∞F wind chill threshold mentioned in the criteria.

- **Wind Speed**: The highest wind speed recorded is 14.1MPH, which, while noticeable, does not pose an extreme risk in terms of exacerbating the cold or significantly impacting visibility, as there is no accompanying snowfall.

- **Visibility**: Visibility remains at a minimum of 6.0 miles throughout the night, which is sufficient for safe travel and does not meet criteria for concern.

- **Precipitation**: There is no expected snowfall or any other form of precipitation during the monitored hours, thus removing the risk of slippery roads or obscured visibility due to snow.

Given the lack of severe weather conditions, such as extreme cold, high winds, low visibility, or precipitation, combined with the conservative nature required for assessing a snow day, the likelihood of Rockford Public Schools declaring a snow day based on the weather data provided seems low.

Considering all factors and the importance of not hastily declaring a snow day unless absolutely necessary, I predict a **5% chance** of a snow day. This low percentage reflects the absence of critical weather conditions that would significantly impact safety and transportation. üå®Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
