Alright, dudes and dudettes of Rockford Public Schools, let's chat snow day here. So, it's December in Michigan, we know it can totally throw down on the frosty front, but here's the thing - both today and tomorrow's weather reports are seriously low on flurry factor. I mean, a whole 0% chance of snow? That's not gonna build no winter wonderland. And temperatures? Sure, they're chilly enough to need your rad winter coat, but nowhere near that ice-biting -20F threshold the school mentions. Plus, no alerts or warnings to crank up the crisis level. In the immortal words of our esteemed Superintendent Dr. Matthews, it's 'not an exact science', but if I had to give it a go, I'd say there's a 0% chance of a snow day tomorrow. So sorry to rain on your parade, guys. Or not rain. Or snow. You get me. Fire up the homework, looks like we're on for a standard school day. Stay cool, Rockford.
