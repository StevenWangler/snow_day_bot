Yo! So, let's break it down. Tomorrow ain't looking too bad. No snow, no rain, a bit on the chilly side but Rockford's used to it, you feel? Like, it's Michigan in January, so that's no surprise. Now, without any snow in the forecast, our percentage chance for a snow day is looking pretty slim, like we're talking 0%. Sorry, homies. Days like this, we just gotta bundle up and head to school. Stay cool, and don't forget your jackets!
