Well, folks it appears we have a bit of a winter wonderland on our hands in the Rockford Public School area. Current forecasts show a 66% chance of snow coupled with a chilling wind chill of 19.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Now let's factor in the Winter Weather Advisory currently in effect until later this afternoon, signaling slippery road conditions due to wet snow accumulations of up to an inch.Keep in mind, Rockford School district covers a vast 97 square miles and the weather conditions can differ greatly, affecting the safe transport of the large proportion of students who rely on school transport. The district authorities are zealous in their careful monitoring of weather, wind-chill, wind speed, temperature and precipitation, engaging in diligent dialogues with county road commission and adjacent districts about the road conditions. Considering these factors, including the winter weather advisory, the forecast for tomorrow, and the school's careful snow day policy, I would put the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools at about 60%. While it's not a sure thing, the weather conditions and the school's commitment to student safety do enhance the likelihood. Stay tuned, Rockford, and be ready for a possible snow day tomorrow. Remember to keep warm and safe in these weather conditions.
