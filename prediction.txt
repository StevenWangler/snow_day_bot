Hey, what's up? So I've been checking out the weather scoop and everything for our Rockford zone, and it honestly looks a straight 0% chance we're getting a snow day tomorrow. Like, yeah it's December and all, Michigan winters and stuff, but temp's hanging above freezing, dude. Itâ€™s gonna be around 37 degrees Fahrenheit. Besides, all the forecasts are pointing to rain, no snow in sight. Closest we are getting to a snowfall is maybe some slush puddles. So, brace for soggy shoes, not cozy snow day snugs. Peace out!
