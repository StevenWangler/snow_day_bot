Yo, what's upp? In real talk, the chance of us having a snow day tomorrow is legit 0%. Yeah, it's December and Michigan winters can be all wild and icy, but just look at the weather, man! Even though the temps are kinda chill, the weather peeps say there ain't gonna be any snow or even rain. Just some partly cloudy action going on. Anyway, the school only shuts things down when the wind chill hits -20F or colder, and we're not anywhere near that. So, throw your beanie in the back of your locker and be ready for class.
