Yo, what's up? So let's talk the chance of a totally tubular snow day tomorrow for Rockford Schools - not gonna sugarcoat it, prospects look slim, dude. The high is 45.5 degrees, the low's dropping to 34.9, but that's a far cry from the really chilly -20F when the school normally shuts down. No snow, no rain, zilch, from the forecasts. Yeah, it's gonna be cloudy, but clouds don't always mean snow, right? So with all that, I'm saying a 0% chance for a snow day tomorrow. Bummer, I know, but it's gotta be real out here. Stay warm and see you in school!
