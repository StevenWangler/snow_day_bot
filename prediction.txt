Alright dudes and dudettes, gonna keep it real with ya. Looking at the weather, it's kinda frigid out there but tomorrow's looking to be all sun and no snow or rain. That successful snow day formula of chill weather, lots of snow and poor road conditions just isn't adding up. So, I gotta lay down the hard truth, looks like a 0% chance we're scoring a snow day tomorrow. Keep those textbooks handy, we're back to hitting the grind. Seriously though, stay warm out there.
