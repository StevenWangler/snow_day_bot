Well folks, bundling up is on the agenda for tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools! With the current weather forecast in hand and considering the school district's snow day policy, it looks like there could be a flurry of activity on the snow day front. A Winter Weather Advisory is currently in effect, with a likelihood of expected hazardous road conditions due to substantial accumulated snowflows, which will definitely impact the morning commute and could cause quite a slip and slide situation. Adding to this rich wintery mix, tomorrow's forecast predicts a high chance of snow at 83%, coupled with a chilling 'feels like' temperature of 21.0 degrees Fahrenheit which is just few hairbreadths away from the school's -20F wind chill factor for shutting the school. Furthermore, the looming possibility of rain at 60% and an average humidity of 96% might turn the accumulated snow into sludge, making road conditions even more treacherous. Given these factors, I'd say the chance of a snow day occurring tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools is riding high at a substantial 75%. Looks like our students might be in for a day of snowball fights and building frosty friends! Make sure you bundle up, folks, and stay safe! Remember, you heard it first right here on the Weather News Network!
