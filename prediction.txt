Based on the Rockford Public Schools snow day factor information, decision-makers consider multiple weather parameters such as wind chill, temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and the impact on transportation and infrastructure to determine the likelihood of a snow day.

Turning our attention to the weather data provided, the temperatures from 7 PM through 8 AM range narrowly around the freezing mark, with consistently high humidity and full cloud cover that resulted in foggy conditions throughout the night. Temporarily high chances of snow and rain at 7 PM transitioned into a persistent foggy environment with low visibility and no active precipitation being reported for the remainder of the night. These conditions, while uncomfortable, do not immediately substantiate a clear deviation from the threshold operational conditions for the school.

Furthermore, as for the active Winter Weather Advisory, this alert does not include Kent County, where Rockford Public Schools are located but rather mentions adjacent counties with slippery road conditions due to mixed precipitation, indicating a situation that should be monitored closely but, as of the data cut-off, does not directly affect the county in question.

With the conservative nature of snow day declarations in mind, combined with the absence of significant snow accumulation or severe temperature drops that would prompt a clear hazard to students, the overall snow day probability remains relatively low. However, the continuous monitoring practice of the district's officials suggests potential for reassessment should weather patterns shift unexpectedly overnight.

Thus, taking a very careful and conservative approach, I would estimate the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools to be about 10%. This low percentage reflects the critical fact that despite unpleasant fog and cold temperatures, the historical data and specific criteria for a snow day are not conclusively met, with no immediate severe weather threats observed in the hourly data. üòå‚ùÑ 

The school and district officials will continue to monitor conditions closely. If road conditions worsen, or if any new advisories affect Kent County specifically, the chance of a snow day could increase accordingly. Be sure to check in for any updates before school time! Stay cozy and warm, Rockford! ‚òïüß£üìö
