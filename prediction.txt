Based on the detailed weather analysis, considering the key factors outlined in Rockford Public Schools' snow day criteria such as temperature drops, wind chill, wind speeds, and precipitation types; and given the additional factor of precipitation transitioning from rain to light snow showers by the early morning without significant snow accumulation or extremely low temperatures, the predicted likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is 📉 **40%**.

This decision reflects a conservative approach, noting the absence of severe weather conditions, such as extreme cold temperatures or heavy snowfall, that would significantly increase the risk of unsafe travel conditions or infrastructure challenges.
