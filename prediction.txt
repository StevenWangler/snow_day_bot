Yo, here's the deal: Ain't gonna be no snow day tomorrow for us at Rockford Public Schools, man. Even though we're in Michigan and it's December, the temps are way too high for any ice to stick around. We got more of a chance to see a dance-off in the cafeteria than to see snowflakes. Plus, the forecast is saying that all weâ€™re gonna get is some rain, not snow. Truly, the chances of a snow day happening are 0%. Better keep that alarm set for the morning, Rockford peeps, we're going to school. Peace out!
