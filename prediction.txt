Based on the criteria provided for determining a snow day at Rockford Public Schools, several key weather parameters are considered critical: wind chill, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation (including snowfall, sleet, and freezing rain). The decision is also influenced by the impact on transportation and infrastructure (road conditions and the condition of heating systems in schools and vehicles), as well as the accuracy and variability of weather forecasts.

Analyzing the provided hourly weather data, the conditions from 7 PM to 8 AM are uniformly clear, with no precipitation (snow or rain) reported. Temperatures gradually decrease from 46.6¬∞F to 34.1¬∞F, and wind speeds range from 5.6 to 7.6MPH. Notably, temperatures remain well above freezing initially, only approaching and slightly dropping below freezing in the early morning hours. The lowest wind chill recorded is 28.2¬∞F at 7 AM, which, while cold, is significantly warmer than the dangerous -20¬∞F threshold highlighted in the criteria. Moreover, there are no active weather alerts for Kent County where the school is located.

Given the analysis, and considering the extremely conservative nature required for predicting a snow day:

- **Wind Chill and Temperature:** Both factors don't reach the extremely dangerous marks mentioned in the snow day criteria. 
- **Precipitation:** There's no precipitation, hence no risk of snowfall, sleet, or freezing rain affecting road conditions or visibility.
- **Wind Speed:** Although increasing slightly, the wind speeds do not combine with low temperatures and precipitation to pose significant risks.

Considering these factors, the conditions do not meet the criteria for a snow day based on extreme cold, precipitation, or dangerous wind chill values. However, always operating with a margin of safety and acknowledging a slight reducing trend in temperature to just below freezing, a minimal but non-zero chance of unforeseeable impacts on the infrastructure or sudden weather changes overnight should be acknowledged.

Thus, the snow day chance for Rockford Public Schools is estimated to be üå®Ô∏è **10%**. This accounts for the unlikely but possible occurrence of unforeseen factors overnight that could impact the school day, while largely reflecting the overall mild and clear weather conditions reported.
