I've analyzed Rockford Public Schools' snow day factors in combination with the weather data provided. Let's break it down:

Wind Chill and Temperature:
- The wind chill values are well above the -20¬∞F danger threshold throughout the night, ranging from about 2.6 to 10.2¬∞F, so that's relatively safer.

Wind Speed:
- Wind speeds are not excessively high, with gusts peaking around 11.9MPH. This may not significantly impact visibility or contribute dangerously to wind chill.

Precipitation:
- Although moderate to heavy snow is forecasted between hours 1 to 6, the snowfall amount is actually recorded at 0.0cm, indicating no accumulation.

Road Conditions:
- Without significant snowfall accumulation, road conditions may not be severely impacted. The continuous moderate to heavy snow prediction raises some concerns but without actual snowfall accumulation, the impact is less severe.

Visibility:
- Visibility is reduced at times, particularly during hours of heavier snow, but it remains at 1.0 to 3.0 miles which isn't fully prohibitive for transportation.

Snow Day Criteria File Analysis:
- The key parameters mentioned include wind chill, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation, with an emphasis on the impact on transportation and infrastructure. The weather data does indicate moderate to heavy snow, but this hasn't translated into actual snowfall, and wind chill temperatures, while cold, are not hazardous.


No Weather Alerts:
- There are no active weather alerts for the county, implying that the weather situation is not severe enough at this time to warrant urgent attention.

Given the conservative nature required for snow day decisions and the fact that there are no active weather alerts for severe weather conditions, it would be illogical to predict a high chance of a snow day. The monitoring of multiple parameters, as indicated by the criteria file, shows conditions that may cause some concern but likely do not meet the threshold for closing the school.

Taking all these factors into consideration, and especially the absence of snow accumulation which would be a primary concern for dangerous traveling conditions, the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is estimated to be LOW.

The data does not support a high likelihood of a snow day, keeping in line with the conservative approach needed for such a prediction. Please continue to monitor updates through the night, as conditions may change. Stay warm and safe! ‚ùÑÔ∏èüå°Ô∏è
