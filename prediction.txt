Given the weather data provided:

- Temperature remains significantly above freezing throughout the night, starting at 66.4¬∞F at 7 PM and dropping to 47.4¬∞F by 7 AM. 
- Conditions include overcast, patchy rain, light rain showers, and moderate or heavy rain, but no snow or sleet.
- Chance of snow remains at 0% throughout.
- Wind speeds range between 6.9MPH to 15.2MPH, and gusts up to 26.4MPH.
- Wind chill values correspond closely with actual temperatures, indicating that it feels slightly cooler but not excessively cold.
- Precipitation is consistent, indicating wet but unfrozen conditions.

Given these observations and the criteria for a snow day at Rockford Public Schools:

- The lack of snowfall, sleet, and freezing temperatures during these hours does not align with the critical conditions typically leading to a snow day based on the criteria.
- Wind chill and actual temperatures are well above the -20¬∞F threshold, minimizing concerns of frostbite or hypothermia.
- Precipitation in the form of rain, not snow or ice, reduces the likelihood of dangerous road conditions typical of snow days.
- Wind speeds, while notable, are not at a level that would significantly contribute to hazardous conditions by themselves.

Considering the conservative nature required in predicting snow days and the fact there are no weather alerts for severe conditions in Kent County, and the critical parameters for a snow day (significant snowfall, ice, extreme cold, or severe wind chill) are not met within the provided data:

Prediction: The chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is considerably low, due to the absence of snow, mild temperatures, and primarily rainy conditions. I anticipate a **10% chance** of a snow day, largely reflecting the inherent unpredictability of weather and the small possibility of unanticipated changes overnight. üå®Ô∏èüå°Ô∏è‚òî
