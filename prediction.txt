Brrrrr, Blizzard here to assess the snow day likelihood for Rockford Public Schools! As the world's chilliest prediction expert, I've analyzed the frosty details from 7 PM to 8 AM and considered the key snow day factors for the district.

🌫️ Evening Analysis (7 PM - 11 PM): The conditions were mostly misty to light drizzle with temperatures hovering just above freezing. Not ideal for snow-day dreams, as the temperatures were too warm for snow and the chance of snow was firmly at 0%. Visibility was reduced to 1.0 mile during periods of mist and light drizzle, but that alone isn't enough to warrant a snow day.

🌧️ Midnight to Dawn Analysis (12 AM - 7 AM): The light rain transitioned into moderate rain through 4 AM to 6 AM, with temperatures still too warm for snow. Chance of snow remained at 0%, ruling out snow accumulation. Despite 100% cloud cover and high humidity, these conditions are more soggy than snowy.

📊 Snow Day Factors Reference: According to the Rockford Public Schools snow day criteria, critical factors include wind chill, temperature, wind speed, precipitation, road conditions, and district transportation. The wind chill did drop, but not to the concerning -20°F mentioned in the criteria.

🌧️ Precipitation Perspective: Moderate rain is wet, not white, so the impact on road conditions would be from water, not ice, considering temperatures stayed above freezing. Visibility dropped to 4.0 miles with moderate rain, which could warrant caution but not necessarily a closure.

🚌 Transportation Thoughts: There's no indication that road conditions are icy, just wet. The district transportation should be operational, albeit with extra caution in the wet conditions.

🔍 Weather Alert Assessment: The Hydrologic Outlook focuses on rising river levels and potential flooding by the weekend due to snowmelt and rain, not immediate snow-related hazards that would affect tomorrow morning. It's important, but not a factor inducing a snow day for tomorrow.

In summary, the weather patterns exhibit dampness and chilliness, but they aren't aligning with the blizzardy blast required for a snow day. No substantial snowfall, no severe ice, and the Hydrologic Outlook doesn't meet the urgency level to justify closing schools tomorrow.

Therefore, taking into account the soaking situation and relying on the conservative superintendent perspective, Blizzard predicts a snow day chance of:

❄️ 10% ❄️

Just a gentle flurry of possibility based purely on reduced visibility and wet, but not icy, roads. Remember, being conservative means preserving those precious snow days for when the weather really roars! Stay warm and safe out there, Rockford! 🌨️👍
