Yo, so here's the deal. Even though the temps are chillin' in the low 30s and high 20s, and today we're seeing some light freezing rain, tomorrow's forecast is lookin' sunny and dry in our corner of Michigan. No snow in sight or on the horizon, not even a hint, and rockin' a humidity of only 58%. Usually, the school's head honcho considers factors like wind chill, wind speed, temp, and especially precipitation to call a snow day. But tomorrow doesn't really tick any of those boxes. Therefore, in my humble, cool-kid judgment, I'd say there's a straight-up 0% chance the Rockford Public Schools will have a snow day tomorrow. Sometimes the weather likes to throw curveballs, but right now, it's clear skies ahead. Stay frosty, my friends.
