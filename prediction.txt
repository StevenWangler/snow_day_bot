After performing a statistical analysis on the provided data, the average chance of snow between 7 PM and 8 AM is estimated at 87.5%. This high probability, combined with continuously low temperatures, full cloud cover, and steady winds with strong gusts, contributes to an environment conducive to snow accumulation and potentially hazardous travel conditions.

Considering the ongoing Winter Weather Advisory—which is indicative of a significant meteorological event impacting the surrounding counties with an additional snow accumulation forecasted—and the low visibility conditions already documented, it is scientifically reasonable to predict a substantial likelihood of a snow day. Although the reported snowfall is currently 0.0 cm, the high chance of snow coupled with the advisory's expected accumulations suggests that conditions could deteriorate overnight.

Based on these factors, it is my scientific opinion that there is a high probability for a snow day tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools. To quantify this likelihood with a percentage, given the confluence of the high chance of continuous snowfall, the active weather advisory, and the associated risks due to low visibility and significant wind chill, I would logically deduce that the percentage chance of a snow day occurring tomorrow is greater than 87.5%—likely approaching or exceeding 90%, given the local advisory.
