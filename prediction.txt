Analyzing the provided hourly weather data from 7 PM to 8 AM for Rockford Public Schools and considering the detailed snow day criteria, let's discuss the key factors from both our data and the criteria:

1. **Wind Chill**: A sustained wind chill of -20Â°F is highlighted as dangerous. However, the observed wind chills remain well above this threshold, not dropping below 43.7Â°F.
2. **Temperature**: The criteria mention the importance of absolute temperature readings, with extreme cold temperatures posing risks. Throughout the night and into the early morning, temperatures gradually decrease but stay well above freezing, with the lowest recorded temperature being 44.5Â°F.
3. **Wind Speed**: The document notes that higher wind speeds can exacerbate cold temperatures and affect visibility. Wind speeds in the data provided do taper off overnight, starting at 15.9MPH and ending at a light breeze of 2.0MPH by 7 AM, suggesting no significant exacerbation of conditions that could warrant a closure based on this factor alone.
4. **Precipitation**: The criteria outline the importance of snowfall, sleet, and freezing rain in assessing safety. Throughout the observation period, there is 0% chance of snow and no precipitation, indicating clear conditions without the threat of accumulating snow or ice on roads and pathways.
5. **Weather Forecast Accuracy & Impact on Transportation and Infrastructure**: Given the clear conditions and the lack of any precipitation or extreme cold, both transportation and infrastructure are unlikely to be negatively impacted. Notably, there are no active weather alerts for Kent County, underscoring the absence of severe weather conditions that could disrupt school operations.
