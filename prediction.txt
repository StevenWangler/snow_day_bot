After analyzing the provided hourly weather data for Rockford Public Schools, here are the key findings based on the snow day criteria:

- The average temperature from 7 PM to 8 AM is approximately 22.6Â°F, which is quite cold but not excessively so.
- The average wind chill during this period is around 9.2Â°F, significantly cold but above the critical -20Â°F threshold outlined in the snow day criteria.
- The average wind speed is about 15.6 MPH with maximum gusts reaching 22.3 MPH. While these speeds are strong, they don't substantially impact the already low wind chill to a dangerous level.
- Snowfall is expected to be light, with only a short period of patchy light snow noted and no significant accumulation (0.0cm across all hours).

An active Winter Weather Advisory mentioned additional snow accumulations of up to one inch, with winds gusting as high as 45 MPH. However, this advisory expires at 4 PM the day before, therefore, its direct impact on the school day seems limited.

Considering all these factors with a conservative superintendent perspective:
- The temperatures and wind chill, while cold, are not at extreme risk levels for frostbite or hypothermia during short exposure times.
- The wind speeds and gusts could impact visibility and make travel slightly more hazardous, but the overall conditions do not seem severe enough to significantly disrupt transportation or infrastructure.
- The advisory, though indicative of caution, has expired, and its conditions appear to have lessened in severity by the time considered for this analysis.

Given the key parameters and the conservative approach to allocating snow days, the chance of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools seems relatively low. However, considering the presence of patchy light snow and the advisory, albeit expired, indicates a need for some caution.

Chance of a snow day: ðŸŒ¨ 20%

This prediction takes into account all weather conditions provided, including the Existing weather alert, albeit expired, and follows a very careful approach, aware of the need not to allocate snow days lightly.
