Based on the snow day criteria for Rockford Public Schools, here are the key factors to consider for predicting the likelihood of a snow day:

- **Weather Monitoring:** Continuous evaluation of weather conditions is crucial, particularly paying attention to updates from meteorological sources.

- **Wind Chill:** Extremely dangerous conditions are considered at a sustained wind chill of -20¬∞F, which significantly increases the risk of frostbite and hypothermia.

- **Temperature:** Absolute temperatures, independent of wind chill, are also critical. Extreme cold can affect individuals and infrastructure alike.

- **Wind Speed:** High wind speeds can worsen cold impacts and affect visibility, essential to consider, particularly when combined with precipitation.

- **Precipitation:** The amount and rate of snowfall, sleet, or freezing rain are vital in assessing travel safety and the condition of roads and school grounds.

- **Forecast Accuracy:** Predictions are probabilistic and may not always be reliable, necessitating caution in decision-making based on immediate and anticipated weather conditions.

- **Impact on Transportation and Infrastructure:** Conditions of roads, district transportation capabilities (especially buses), and school facilities (heating systems and buildings) are significant considerations.

Given these guidelines and the conservative superintendent mentality, let's analyze the provided hourly weather data from 7 PM to 8 AM for Rockford Public Schools:
- Weather conditions were consistently clear from 7 PM to 8 AM, with no report of snow or rain, and temperatures ranged roughly from 29.9¬∞F to 36.0¬∞F.
- Wind speeds were moderate, peaking at 15.2MPH at 7 PM and gradually decreasing through the night.
- No severe weather alerts or advisories were active for Kent county, indicating no imminent extreme weather threats.

üå®Ô∏è Prediction Analysis:
- **Wind Chill & Temperature:** Despite somewhat chilly conditions, the weather did not approach the critical -20¬∞F wind chill mark or display extreme cold temperatures that could justify a snow day.
- **Wind Speed & Visibility:** Wind speeds were not exceptionally high to significantly impact visibility or create hazardous conditions.
- **Precipitation:** There was no precipitation, hence no snow accumulation or icy roads to concern.
- **Alerts:** The absence of weather alerts for the area signals no immediate severe weather threats that could impact the following school day.

Given the conservative approach required and the absence of critical weather conditions that align with the school's snow day criteria, the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is minimal.

üìâ Snow Day Chance: 0%

The weather appears conducive for regular school operations, and there's no strong justification for a snow day based on the analyzed conditions and the outlined criteria. Safety and infrastructure concerns seem manageable under the current weather scenario. Stay warm and prepare for school tomorrow!
