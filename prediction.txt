After analyzing the weather data for Rockford Public Schools from 7 PM to 8 AM, here are my findings:

- The lowest "feels like" temperature observed was 13.3°F, which is significantly warmer than the -20°F wind chill threshold mentioned in the snow day criteria. ❄️
- The average wind speed overnight was approximately 11.4 MPH, indicating moderate conditions that might not severely impact visibility or exacerbate cold exposure. 🌬️
- The total snowfall amount recorded was very minimal, totaling 0.06cm, which is unlikely to significantly affect road conditions or require considerable cleanup efforts. 🌨️
- The maximum chance of snow was 82%, primarily during the early hours, indicating a possibility of light snow which aligns with the observed snowfall amount.

Given these observations and adhering to the extremely conservative superintendent mentality, the impact on transportation and infrastructure appears minimal, with the weather conditions not reaching the critical thresholds outlined in the snow day criteria (e.g., very low wind chill, substantial snowfall affecting roads and infrastructure).

Therefore, considering the conservative approach towards issuing snow days, the likelihood of a snow day for Rockford Public Schools based on the provided data would be low. I estimate the chance of a snow day at **10%**. Schools and buses should operate normally, albeit with potential minor adjustments for safely navigating the modestly cooler conditions and light snowfall observed. Always exercise caution during winter conditions. Stay warm and safe! 🧣🏫
