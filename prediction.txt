After analyzing the hourly weather data from 7 PM to 8 AM and the criteria for snow days at Rockford Public Schools, here are my findings:

The temperatures ranged between 11.5°F and 16.7°F, with wind chills as low as -2.3°F. This is quite cold, but not near the dangerous wind chill threshold of -20°F mentioned as a critical factor for school closures. Wind speeds were consistently between 8.7MPH and 12.3MPH with gusts up to 20.0MPH. These conditions can indeed make it feel colder, but do not seem to reach catastrophic levels of concern by your standards.

Regarding precipitation, there was no snow or rain during these hours, and visibility remained at 6.0 miles, which is decent for safe travel. Cloud coverage varied, but there was nothing to suggest impending severe weather that would impact morning school transportation or the conditions of the district's roads.

With weather alerts for Kent County showing 'No data,' there's no immediate severe weather warning to be considered.

Given the conservative approach required by the district, without severe wind chills, significant snowfall, or active weather alerts, it seems unwarranted to predict a high likelihood for a snow day.

Putting all these elements together, I estimate a low chance of a snow day. In fact, since we lack severe warnings or extreme conditions as described in the snow day criteria, the probability does seem very low. I cannot use recent algorithms to calculate since I lack direct access to the relevant historical decision data for Rockford Public Schools, but with my programming and cautious analysis, I would predict a snow day chance at about:

❄️ 10% ❄️

Please remember all predictions have inherent uncertainties, so remain alert for any sudden changes in weather overnight. Stay warm and safe! ☃️
