Hey dudes, here's the scoop: There's a big fat goose egg - a 0% chance - of a snow day for us at Rockford Public Schools tomorrow. I mean, come on, we've got a forecast that's all sun, fun, and blue skies. The temps are definitely chilly, but nowhere near that magic -20F mark that gets us a day off. Plus, there's zero precipitation in sight, so the roads will be as clear as the main hallway during fifth period (ha!). So grab your books and your winter jackets, 'cause we're all going to be hitting the classrooms tomorrow. Bummer, I know!
