❄️ After my detailed analysis taking into account the various factors, I predict a snow day chance of approximately 5%. The weather conditions, while cold, appear generally clear with zero expected snowfall. The combination of these factors makes it unlikely that a snow day will be declared. Remember, this estimation is based on current data and things may change as we move closer into tomorrow morning. Stay warm and prepared! ❄️🧣
