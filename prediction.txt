After carefully analyzing the hourly weather data from 7 PM to 8 AM for Rockford Public Schools, here’s what I found: 

- The average temperature was approximately 28.9°F, with the lowest dipping to 27.6°F. This is above the extreme cold temperatures that are considered detrimental, and there was no snow or ice precipitation to worsen road conditions.
- The average wind speed was around 8.3 MPH, with a minimum of 5.6 MPH. This is mild and does not significantly impact visibility or exacerbate the cold to dangerous levels.
- The average wind chill was around 20.9°F, with the lowest at 20.4°F. Although chilly, this is far from the -20°F threshold indicating severe risk and potential school closures.

Given these observations and the absence of any weather alerts, 🌨️ conditions appear regular for a Michigan winter night without posing severe disruptions or safety concerns. Considering the criteria provided and the district’s conservative stance on declaring snow days, the conditions do not seem to meet the threshold for extreme cold, significant snowfall, or hazardous wind speeds that would necessitate a school closure based on an exceptional weather event.

Therefore, considering all elements and maintaining an extremely conservative superintendent mentality, I estimate the chance of a snow day tomorrow for Rockford Public Schools to be at **10%**. This prediction acknowledges the criteria set by the district while recognizing that the observed weather conditions, though cold, do not significantly endanger transportation or infrastructure. Stay warm and prepared! ⛄📚
