The decision to declare a snow day for Rockford Public Schools is influenced by various factors, including wind chill, temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. For a snow day to be considered, critical conditions such as:

- Wind chill reaching sustained levels of -20°F or below
- Extreme cold temperatures affecting individuals and infrastructure
- High wind speeds exacerbating cold effects and reducing visibility
- Heavy precipitation impacting safe travel and road conditions

Here's an overview of the key weather observations from 7 PM to 8 AM:

- Temperature ranged from 7.7°F to 10.3°F
- Moderate snow was reported with 100% chance of snow from 1 AM to 7 AM
- Wind speeds increased overnight, with wind chills dropping as low as -7.5°F by 7 AM
- Visibility remained at 3.0 miles during hours of moderate snowfall

Given these observed weather conditions, the likelihood of a snow day is increased due to the continuous moderate snow, reduced visibility, cold temperatures, and particularly the drop in wind chill values, despite the absence of a wind chill advisory for Kent County.

However, considering the provided information and the lack of an active relevant weather alert for Kent County, the chance for a snow day for Rockford Public Schools should not exceed 50%. Taking into account the conservative approach towards predicting snow days and that decisions are ultimately made by school officials, I estimate the chance of a snow day at 45%.

Remember, final decisions depend on school officials and might incorporate additional factors beyond the weather data, including real-time updates and infrastructural considerations. ❄️🌨️📉🏫
